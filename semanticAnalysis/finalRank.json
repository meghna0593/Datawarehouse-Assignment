ofrecord production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipatedin canada  some improvement in south america and new capacityin south korea      dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are

dedicated lead mines planned and thereforesupply of concentrates largely dependent on by products fromzinc mines      on this basis  our calculations point to a modestoversupply of lead concentrates in 1987   briggs said     the copper forecast  however  was for a recordnon socialist output of 6 6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987 increasing by a further 150 000 tonnes in 1988     production of

on april one put oil stocks held in the oecdarea at 428 mln tonnes  or 98 days of forward consumption  thisis about the same as at the begining of the year     the agency said this flat trend is

this followed a small rise in january of400 000 bpd but a decline of 1 5 bpd in february and 2 5 bpd inmarch     and it is possible that final data will show a larger draw particulary for march  it said     as crude production also fell  there is likely to have alsobeen a decline in non reported stocks  particularly at sea  theiea said     world oil supply fell through the first quarter by abouttwo bpd to 45 2 bpd from 47 5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986     this drop was mostly due to a decline in opec crudeproduction to around 15 5 bpd in february march from 16 5 bpdin january and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrallyplanned economies  the iea said     total opec oil supply totalled 17 2 bpd in the firstquarter of 1987 compare with 19 3 bpd in the last three monthsof 1986 while supply from non opec countries totalled 28 bpd asagainst 28 2 bpd in the same 1986 period     a drop in saudi arabian output to a tentatively forecast3 3 bpd in march from 3 6 bpd in february

probably try to hang onto encor as long asthey can   said bache securities inc analyst doug weber     some of dome s group of 56 major creditors might move toblock such a sale  arguing they have a

stumbling block would be encor s 225 mln dlr jointliability in loans to dome petroleum advanced by arcticpetroleum corp of japan for beaufort sea exploration     analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder thepossible sale of dome petroleum s interest in dome mines     dome mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of dome petroleum sdebt and has a  right of consent  to the sale of dome petroleum

uppermanent target zones for exchange rates  gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree andenforce on an international level      at present levels the dollar can no longer be consideredgrossly overvalued in relation to the european currencies andthe yen   gleske said     he said the dollar had fallen much less against currenciesof important trading nations such as canada  korea  taiwan andhong kong  and further falls there may still be necessary     but  a further dollar depreciation against major europeancurrencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore thedollar to a fully competitive position  as measured by itsweighted external value   he said    in fact  a further marked decline in the dollar rate wouldhold two major dangers  gleske said     first  in countries with large balance of paymentssurpluses such as japan and west germany  it threatened tohamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of realincome and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe outsurpluses     second  in the united states  it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness tofinance huge fiscal and external payments deficits  gleskesaid     gleske also was strongly sceptical that an internationalsystem of binding target zones for currencies  fluctuating innarrow bands against each other  can be established  suchtargets threatened to cause policy conflicts   both withincountries and between them      for instance  the u s  reliance on foreign capital to fundits deficits requires interest rates there be set at highlevels  but domestic considerations call for low ones     if target zones were established  this would put  pressureon other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domesticsituation and priorities   he said     gleske added   targeting the exchange rate even within awide margin will meet with serious objections where there is aclearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic andexternal policy priorities      commenting on the paris currency accord  gleske said itschances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on currentinterest rate differentials being maintained     these chances  seem to me to rest critically on theexpectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them  will assure smoothfinancing of current account imbalances in the months ahead      gleske said past experience of currency adjustments hadlearned  that markets

ifmarkets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies willlead to balanced international payments  he said  reuter  3 "}, {"article": "reut_article19014", "rank": 0.016348029022172413, "content":
